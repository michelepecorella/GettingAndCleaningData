In this script are used three packages: dplyr (in particular select function), reshape2 (in particular melt and dcast functions) and data.table (for saving in the computer the tidydata with write.table function)
So the first action made is to load these packages
The the script create a folder named data, download the zip file and unzip that file only if this three actions aren't made yet.
Then the following text file are loaded in R:
subtrain: it's the subject_train.txt
xtrain: it's the X_train.txt
ytrain: it's the y_train.txt
feat: it's the features.txt
aclabel: it's the activity_labels.txt

Then, it's gave the names to the columns of xtrain (that are the different measuraments of our exercise)
After this it's merged the aclabel and ytrain in such a way that is replaced the number of the activity with the names of the activity
Are merged the subtrain and the new ytrain and give to this new file (tidytrain) the coloumns names.
Then are ad to tidytrain also the measuraments of xtrain.

The same thing is made with the test files. This are the other text files loaded:
subtest: it's the subject_test.txt
xtest: it's the X_test.txt
ytest: it's the y_test.txt
It's create a file called tidytest where all the files inherent at the test are linked together

The tidytrain and tidytest are joint together and create the result file.

Then the script select only the measuraments that have in the names the word "mean" and "std" and there is in this moment the creation of a new file called resmeanstd
Then is necessary to trasform the resmeanstd in a long format with the function melt and this is necessary for create a file where is calculate the mean of each subject intersect with each activity intersect with each variables.

At the end the file is saved in the computer
